This repository contains implementations of various data analysis and machine learning tasks using Python. Each section below provides a brief overview of the problem statement, methods used, and key findings.

Problem Statement: Summary Statistics and Data Visualization

Description: Compute summary statistics and visualize data distributions for a given dataset.
Methods: Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations.
Key Findings: The summary statistics provide insights into the dataset's characteristics, while visualizations such as histograms offer intuitive representations of data distributions.

Problem Statement: Customer Response Prediction

Description: Predict customer responses for special offers based on demographic information and purchase history.
Methods: Employ machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests using Scikit-learn in Python.
Key Findings: Accurate predictions enable businesses to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement, leading to increased sales and satisfaction.

Problem Statement: K-means Clustering

Description: Perform k-means clustering on a collection of 8 points in a 2-dimensional space.
Methods: Implement the k-means clustering algorithm in Python to segment the dataset into clusters based on similarities between data points.
Key Findings: Clustering results determine which cluster each point belongs to and provide insights into the population of clusters and updated centroid values.

Problem Statement: Regression Analysis

Description: Apply linear regression to predict month-wise temperatures using temperature data of India.
Methods: Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas for data preprocessing and Scikit-learn for linear regression modeling.
Key Findings: Regression models provide predictions of month-wise temperatures, with model performance assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared.

Problem Statement: Admission Prediction using Decision Trees

Description: Build a decision tree classifier to predict student admissions based on GRE scores and academic performance.
Methods: Perform data preprocessing, train-test split, and decision tree modeling using Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.
Key Findings: Decision tree classifier predicts student admissions, with model evaluation conducted using metrics like accuracy and precision.
